The Aviation Flight Search app is a simple tool designed to make finding the latest real-time flight information quick and easy. It connects to the AviationStack API to fetch details such as airline names, flight numbers, departure and arrival airports, and flight statuses. Going for a minimalist, simple design, it caters to a variety of users, from aviation enthusiasts and travellers to colleagues needing quick access to reliable flight data across airlines.

This application also highlights the growing importance of real-time data in the aviation industry, where up-to-date information is needed for managing schedules and addressing delays. While airlines have websites to track their own flights, it is beneficial to have an app that considers all airlines, and clearly displays only the information that is key, reducing background 'noise' and info. While the current version focuses on retrieving flight data, there is significant potential for future enhancements. Features like real-time flight tracking, notifications for flight updates, or even integration with booking systems could turn this into a more comprehensive tool. The benefit with starting minimlaistic is that it is easy to expand in an agile manner depending on user feedback and experience.
